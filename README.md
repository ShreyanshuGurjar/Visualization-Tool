# Interactive-visualization-

Interactive web application to visualize cancer-specific PPI networks alongside metabolic pathway activities. In this design, we use Python’s Dash framework with its Cytoscape component for network visualization and Plotly for interactive plots. This application lets users interactively filter the network, zoom in/out, and view pathway activity scores in parallel.
