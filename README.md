# Interactive-visualization-Tool

Interactive web application to visualize cancer-specific PPI networks alongside metabolic pathway activities. In this design, we use Pythonâ€™s Dash framework with its Cytoscape component for network visualization and Plotly for interactive plots. This application lets users interactively filter the network, zoom in/out, and view pathway activity scores in parallel.
